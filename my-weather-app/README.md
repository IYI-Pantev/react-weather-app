# 🌦️ React Weather App

A beautiful and responsive weather app built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Bootstrap**.  
Users can search for any city to view **current weather**, **live map preview**, and a **5-day forecast**.  
Data comes from **OpenWeather API** and **OpenStreetMap** with dynamic updates.
